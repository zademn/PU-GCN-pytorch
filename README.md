# PU-GCN Pytorch (Work in progress)

The [PU-GCN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03264) rewritten in Pytorch using [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)

Demo colab [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zademn/pu-gcn-pytorch/blob/master/demo/demo.ipynb)

## Instalation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zademn/PU-GCN-pytorch.git
```
2. Make sure to have [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [pytorch_geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed.  


Torch versions used:
```bash
torch==2.1.0
torch-cluster==1.6.3+pt21cu121
torch-scatter==2.1.2+pt21cu121
torch-sparse==0.6.18+pt21cu121
torch-spline-conv==1.2.2+pt21cu121
torch_geometric==2.4.0
torchaudio==2.1.0
torchinfo==1.8.0
torchvision==0.16.0
```

3. Extra libraries are in the `requirements.txt`. `pip freeze` is in  `requirements_all.txt`


## How to run?
### Training

The  `conf` directory contains configurations (model, train and data configurations) in `yaml` format. The `config.yaml` will hold the current configurations. `<model-name>_config.yaml` are examples of configurations. 
To train a model open the  `Training.ipynb` notebook, load the configuration and run the notebook. **Make sure to specify the data directory**. 

Trained models will be saved in a `trained-models` directory. Each training session will create a new directory with python datetime `%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-<model-name>` format. These directories will contain torch checkpoints with the name `f"ckpt_epoch_{epoch}"`.


### Evaluation
Open the `Evaluation.ipynb` notebook and specify the path to the model you want to evaluate. The results will be in the `results` directory.
