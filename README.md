# PU-GCN Pytorch (Work in progress)

The [PU-GCN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03264) rewritten in Pytorch using [Pytorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric) and layers provided in the [DeepGCN](https://github.com/lightaime/deep_gcns_torch) repository.

## Instalation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zademn/PU-GCN-pytorch.git
```
2. Make sure to have [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [pytorch_geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) installed.  


Torch versions used:
```bash
torch==1.10.2+cu113
torch-cluster==1.5.9
torch-geometric==2.0.3
torch-scatter==2.0.9
torch-sparse==0.6.12
torch-spline-conv==1.2.1
torchaudio==0.10.2+cu113
torchvision==0.11.3+cu113
```

3. Extra libraries are in the `requirements.txt`

4. Chamfer distance is added as a submodule from [this repository](https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX/ChamferDistancePytorch)
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/ThibaultGROUEIX/ChamferDistancePytorch
```

## How to run?
### Training

The `train/` directory contains configurations (model, train and data configurations) in `yaml` format.  
To train a model open the  `Training.ipynb` notebook, load the configuration and run the notebook. **Make sure to specify the data directory**.

Trained models will be saved in a `trained-models` directory. Each training session will create a new directory with python datetime `%Y_%m_%d_%H_%M` format. These directories will contain torch checkpoints with the name `f"ckpt_epoch_{epoch}"`.


### Evaluation
Open the `Evaluation.ipynb` notebook and specify the path to the model you want to train.
